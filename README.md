# Pattern_Offset
### My first pattern create/offset
### differentials: copy to clipboard, the bytes until overwriting the rsp/esp are already subtracted, that is, when the program returns the offset, when you put more bytes it will overwrite the rsp/esp independent of architecture
### the purpose of this script was to understand how the offset pattern worked.

## Usage: lifePattern.py <create | offset> <params>
